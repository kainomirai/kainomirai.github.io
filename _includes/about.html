                        <div class="about-content">
                            I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in BFA Information Design at Ateneo de Manila University. I can create logos, animated GIFs, illustrations, layout designs, and templates for all purposes. In everything I make, I strive to create an experience. I love experimenting with different concepts and styles to keep things exciting and am always on the lookout to stretch my creativity to its limits. Aside from art, I especially enjoy the slice-of-life genre, photography, exploring ideas about the human emotion, and all things nostalgic. Connect with me at contactkaitan@gmail.com
